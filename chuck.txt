Chuck, a scruffy terrier mix with ears that
flopped in perpetually surprised angles,
considered the dandelion in the park his
nemesis. Every morning, during his walk with
his human, Sarah, Chuck would lower his head,
a low growl rumbling in his chest, and
charge. The dandelion, of course, remained
unmoved. Undeterred, Chuck would then try a
different tactic: a delicate sniff, followed
by a sudden, playful pounce. Sometimes, he’d
even attempt to dig it out with enthusiastic,
albeit clumsy, paws. Sarah would chuckle,
watching his daily battle. One sunny
afternoon, a gust of wind finally plucked the
dandelion’s fluffy head and carried it away.
Chuck froze, then looked up at Sarah, a
triumphant bark escaping his throat. He had
finally won, though the victory was more the
wind’s than his own.
