In a quiet forest, a tiny squirrel named Milo loved
to collect shiny acorns. One day, he found a golden
acorn near a sparkling stream. Curious, he followed
a trail of glowing pebbles that led him to a hidden
grove. There, he met a wise old owl who shared
stories of the forestâ€™s magic. Milo returned home,
feeling grateful for the adventure and the new
friend he had made.
